This is the programming repository for Atmospheric Dynamics II (METR 3123) at the University of Oklahoma.

We will use this repository for distributing and posting any data and code for assignments during the semester. 

Homework 3 binder.
NOTE: when opening this binder for the first time, it will build a unique new binder, which can take a while (e.g. 5~20 min). Just allow it to complete, then **save the URL that it brings you into.** This is your new, personal binder, where you can return to any changes you make.

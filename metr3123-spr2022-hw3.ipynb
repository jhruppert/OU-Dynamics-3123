    "### About our programming framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a web-based interactive coding framework that many use as their primary programming platform, because its block formatting caters very well to debugging, while the blocks can be a mix of text (like this one), code, and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please watch the first 3 minutes of this jupyter [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) as an intro. While the remainder of that video covers how to install jupyter on your own machine using Conda, *you are not required to install anything for this assignment.* Kaggle provides an online, fully self-contained approach that removes the need for installing any software. You will complete your assignment by modifying a carbon copy of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run code in this notebook, click on a code block to highlight it, then run it by pressing the Play button in the toolbar (or learn some [keyboard shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/discdiver/9e00618756d120a8c9fa344ac1c375ac)). Do the same thing progressing down the notebook in sequence. In this way, any code error will usually be contained to whichever block you're modifying."

    "The code blocks below are already set up to read in the data and plot geopotential height and wind at 300 hPa.\n",

    "1. Geostrophic wind\n",
    "2. Ageostrophic wind\n",
    "3. Relative vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these calculations will lean heavily on the Python function numpy.gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I have provided some example code using this function that you can leverage for your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the assigment you will both submit a link to your notebook through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) and answer the questions about your results in the Gradescope assignment form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "- You are welcome to explore all available time steps and pressure levels, but I am looking for your results and write-up corresponding to p-level = 300 hPa, time = any\n",
    "- You will simply provide a link to your completed notebook via our Slack channel"

    "### About our programming framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a web-based interactive coding framework that many use as their primary programming platform, because its block formatting caters very well to debugging, while the blocks can be a mix of text (like this one), code, and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please watch the first 3 minutes of this great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) on jupyter as an intro. While the remainder of that video covers how to install jupyter on your own machine, *you will not need to install anything for our programming assignments.* We are using this online, fully self-contained approach called **Binder**, which removes the need for installing any software - rather, we can use this framework to modify preexisting python code for assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this website, you are viewing a newly created **Binder**, which is a carbon copy of our [class Github repository](https://github.com/jhruppert/OU-Dynamics-3123). ***SAVE YOUR BINDER URL IN ORDER TO RETURN TO YOUR WORK.*** What you modify here will not change anything in our class github repository, but you can return to your work at a later time using the same Binder URL. If something goes wrong, you can always click the binder link in our github page again to start a new one."
